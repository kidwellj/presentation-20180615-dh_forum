### What is the point of the CAL DH Forum?

Given the professional “risks” involved in taking on digital projects and research methodologies, and the commensurate need to be pragmatic, tactical, and collaborative, we hope that the CAL DH Forum can help UOB academic staff to:

1. **identify clusters** within digital research methods and technologies in use at the University of Birmingham
1. produce **more coherent and successful requests for funding** and **internal resourcing** on DH projects
1. **share ideas** and new technology, pool expertise, and help to make projects more sustainable
1. consolidate the **profile** of DH at Bham

---

What is the point of this event today?

- To see what kinds of digital humanities scholars @ UOB are practicing
- Strengthen the network
- Welcome new staff to the forum
- Start a longer process of collaborative decision making (==> follow-up workshop TBA for Fall 2018)

## **Spatial** DH Research (Jeremy Kidwell)

“Prophecy now involves a geographical rather than a historical projection; it is space and not time that hides consequences from us. To prophesy today it is only necessary to know men [and women] as they are throughout the world in all their inequality.”

–John Berger cited in Edward Soja,  Postmodern Geographies

# Open Space Technology

---

class: center, middle

## Part 1. Opening Circle

(discuss ground rules, roles, generate ad hoc agenda)

---

## Open Space Technology Principles:

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whenever it starts is the right time ("spirit and creativity do not run on the clock"!)
- Wherever it is, is the right place
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have (be prepared to be surprised!)
- When it's over, it's over... (well, sort of).
